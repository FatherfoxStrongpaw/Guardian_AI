# Security Guidelines

## Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Sandboxed execution environment with Docker isolation
   - Alternative code interpreter for lightweight execution
   - HITL validation for critical operations
   - Circuit breaker protection for resilience
   - Resource limitations and quotas
   - Module whitelisting and import restrictions
   - File integrity monitoring and versioning
   - Change logging and audit trails
   - Variant simulation for security testing

2. **Isolation**
   - Docker containerization
   - Network segmentation
   - Memory restrictions
   - Process isolation

## Configuration

### Sandbox Settings
```yaml
security:
  sandbox:
    enabled: true
    timeout: 10
    max_memory: "512m"
    allowed_modules: ["math", "time", "json"]
    cpu_quota: 100000  # 100ms per second
    network_disabled: true
    readonly_filesystem: true
    docker:
      image: "python:3.12-slim"
      network: "none"
      security_opt: ["no-new-privileges"]
      cap_drop: ["ALL"]
```

### Circuit Breaker Settings
```yaml
resilience:
  circuit_breaker:
    api:
      failure_threshold: 3
      recovery_timeout: 60
      log_failures: true
    database:
      failure_threshold: 3
      recovery_timeout: 60
      log_failures: true
    file_io:
      failure_threshold: 3
      recovery_timeout: 60
      log_failures: true
```

### HITL Controls
- Required approval for system modifications
- Code review interface
- Command validation through the handle_command system
- Access control for system commands
- Sandboxed execution of user-provided commands

## Security Measures

1. **Code Execution**
   - Whitelist-based module access
   - Resource quotas and limitations
   - Timeout enforcement
   - Input validation and code analysis
   - Circuit breaker pattern for external services
   - Fallback mechanisms for service failures
   - Alternative code interpreter for lightweight execution
   - Docker isolation with enhanced security configurations

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted storage
   - Access controls
   - Data retention policies
   - Backup procedures
   - File integrity monitoring
   - Version history and rollback capabilities
   - Change logging and audit trails

3. **System Monitoring**
   - Real-time alerts
   - Audit logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Health checks
   - File integrity verification
   - Variant simulation for security testing
   - Circuit breaker status monitoring

## Security Protocols

1. **Deployment**
   - Environment validation
   - Configuration verification
   - Dependency scanning
   - Security testing

2. **Operation**
   - Continuous monitoring
   - Regular audits
   - Update management
   - Incident response

3. **Maintenance**
   - Security patches
   - Configuration reviews
   - Access management
   - Backup verification

## Emergency Procedures

1. **System Shutdown**
   - Emergency stop procedure
   - State preservation
   - Notification system
   - Recovery process
   - Circuit breaker activation for critical failures

2. **Incident Response**
   - Alert triggers
   - Investigation procedures
   - Containment steps
   - Recovery actions

## Best Practices

1. **Development**
   - Code review requirements
   - Security testing
   - Documentation standards
   - Version control
   - Circuit breaker implementation for all external dependencies
   - Fallback mechanisms for all critical operations

2. **Deployment**
   - Environment isolation
   - Configuration management
   - Access control
   - Monitoring setup

3. **Operation**
   - Regular audits
   - Update procedures
   - Backup verification
   - Incident response
   - Circuit breaker monitoring
   - Resilience testing
