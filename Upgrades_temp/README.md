# Guardian AI Upgrade Project

## Overview

This directory contains all the planning documents, checklists, and tracking files for the Guardian AI upgrade project. The goal of this project is to improve the codebase by resolving duplicate files, standardizing imports, improving the package structure, and enhancing documentation.

## Files in this Directory

- **TODO_CHECKLIST.md**: Comprehensive checklist of all tasks to be completed
- **RECOMMENDATIONS_OVERVIEW.md**: Overview of all recommendations for improving the codebase
- **DUPLICATE_FILES_INTEGRATION.md**: Detailed plan for integrating functionality from duplicate files
- **PACKAGE_STRUCTURE_PLAN.md**: Plan for reorganizing the codebase into a proper Python package
- **IMPORT_STANDARDIZATION.md**: Plan for standardizing imports across the codebase
- **PROGRESS_TRACKER.md**: Tracks the progress of the upgrade project

## How to Use These Files

1. Start with **RECOMMENDATIONS_OVERVIEW.md** to understand the overall goals and recommendations
2. Use **TODO_CHECKLIST.md** to track the completion of individual tasks
3. Refer to the specific plan documents for detailed guidance on each aspect of the upgrade
4. Update **PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** regularly to monitor progress

## Project Phases

1. **Analysis and Planning**: Analyze duplicate files and create integration plans
2. **Integration and Compatibility**: Integrate functionality from duplicate files
3. **Import Standardization**: Standardize imports across the codebase
4. **Documentation Improvements**: Create and update documentation
5. **Package Structure Improvement**: Reorganize the codebase into a proper package
6. **Code Quality Improvements**: Implement automated checks and style guides
7. **Monitoring and Fixing**: Monitor for issues and fix problems
8. **Cleanup**: Remove deprecated files and finalize documentation

## Key Principles

1. **Preserve All Functionality**: Ensure no functionality is lost during the upgrade
2. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Provide compatibility layers for smooth transition
3. **Thorough Testing**: Test all changes to verify functionality
4. **Clear Documentation**: Document all changes and provide migration guides
5. **Gradual Transition**: Implement changes gradually to minimize disruption

## Getting Started

1. Review the **RECOMMENDATIONS_OVERVIEW.md** file
2. Check the current status in **PROGRESS_TRACKER.md**
3. Start working on the tasks in **TODO_CHECKLIST.md**
4. Update the progress tracker as tasks are completed
