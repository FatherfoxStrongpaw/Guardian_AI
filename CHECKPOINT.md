# Guardian AI Checkpoint - Reintegration Complete

## Date
- Checkpoint created: `2024-07-10`

## Summary
This checkpoint marks the successful reintegration of critical functionality from previously overlooked files into the Guardian AI system. The reintegration ensures that all valuable features are preserved while maintaining a clean and well-organized codebase.

## Key Components Reintegrated

### 1. Variant Simulation (from perpetual_agent_old.py)
- Added priority layers and weights for directive execution
- Implemented the simulate_variants method to test different agent behaviors
- Added the adjust_weights method for dynamic priority adjustment
- Integrated variant performance tracking

### 2. Enhanced CLI Interface (from perpetual_agent_old.py)
- Enhanced the run method to handle local shell commands
- Added special handling for analysis commands
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 3. Enhanced Security (from sandbox_excecuter.py)
- Added SandboxSecurityError class for better error handling
- Implemented sandbox_worker for secure code execution
- Enhanced the SandboxExecutor class with stronger security configurations
- Added code validation to prevent dangerous operations
- Improved container security with CPU quotas, network isolation, and filesystem restrictions

### 4. File Monitoring and Versioning (from memory_manager.py)
- Added database tables for file versions, monitoring, and changelog
- Implemented store_file_version and get_file_versions methods
- Added restore_file_version for version rollback
- Implemented register_monitored_file and check_monitored_files for file integrity monitoring
- Added check_file_integrity to detect unauthorized changes
- Added changelog functionality for audit trails

### 5. Code Interpreter (from code_interpreter.py)
- Added the CodeInterpreter class for safe code execution
- Implemented interpreter_worker for subprocess execution
- Added restricted built-ins for security
- Integrated code interpretation into the command system
- Added help text for the new interpret command

## Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with current file names and enhanced security features
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with new components and data flow
- Updated SECURITY.md with enhanced security configurations
- Updated API.md with new methods and classes

## Testing Status
- All tests pass with the reintegrated functionality
- Enhanced test coverage for circuit breaker functionality
- Fixed issues in test_memory_manager.py

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive system tests to verify all reintegrated functionality
2. Consider adding automated file integrity checks on startup
3. Implement periodic monitoring of critical files
4. Create additional tests for the new functionality

## Notes
- The reintegration preserves all valuable functionality while maintaining a clean codebase
- The system now has robust file monitoring, versioning, and change logging to protect itself from malicious code changes
- The enhanced security features provide stronger isolation for code execution
- The variant simulation capabilities enable better security testing
