# Debugging and Validation Plan for LLM Agent Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the debugging and validation strategy for the LLM Agent Framework. In light of recent modifications and external interference, this plan is designed to verify the integrity of all files and dependencies, ensuring the agent operates reliably from the first run.

## Objectives
- Verify the integrity of each module and their dependencies.
- Confirm proper integration between ollama_agent.py and Ollama backend.
- Validate logging, metrics, and error handling for early detection of issues.
- Ensure compatibility with Mistral model.

## Debugging Steps
1. **Static Code Analysis**
   - Run linters and static analysis tools on each file.
   - Verify code formatting, dependency imports, and configuration file usage.
2. **Logging and Metrics Review**
   - Examine log files (e.g., agent.log, rsi_module.log) for errors or inconsistencies.
   - Validate that logging messages appropriately reflect module activity and error levels.
3. **Module Unit Testing**
   - Create and run unit tests for individual modules such as PerpetualLLM, RSIModule, MemoryManager.
   - Simulate various input scenarios, including directive execution and config loading.
4. **Integration Testing**
   - Execute the combined RSI loop and perpetual agent routines.
   - Monitor performance metrics, error thresholds, and directive handling.
5. **Sandbox Functionality Verification**
   - Validate that the sandbox_executor correctly isolates and securely executes provided code.
6. **LLM Backend Validation**
   - Test integration with Ollama in a staging environment, confirming that core logic processes directives as expected.
7. **Feedback and Iterative Refinement**
   - Document any issues discovered during testing.
   - Apply targeted fixes and repeat tests to ensure resolution before final deployment.

## Final Checklist
- [ ] Confirm static code analysis passes without critical errors.
- [ ] Validate log outputs and performance metrics for consistency.
- [ ] Verify successful communication with the Ollama backend using Mistral model.

This plan serves as a comprehensive guide to debugging and validating the entire agent framework, ensuring reliability and a high standard of code quality before deployment.
